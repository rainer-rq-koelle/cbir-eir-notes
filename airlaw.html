<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Rules of the Air</h3>
<p>Applicability
The rules of the air shall apply to aircraft bearing the nationality and registration marks of a Contracting State, wherever they may be, to the extent that they do not conflict with the rules published by the State having jurisdiction over the territory overflown.</p>
<p>over high seas: (unless notified differently) appropriate ATS authority = as designated by the State assuming to provide services under a regional air navigation agreement.</p>
<p>Compliance with the rules of the air<br />
The operation of an aircraft either in flight or on the movement area of an aerodrome shall be in compliance with the general rules and, in addition, when in flight, either with:a) the visual flight rules or b) the instrument flight rules</p>
<p>Responsibility of pilot-in-command<br />
The pilot-in-command of an aircraft shall, whether manipulating the controls or not, be responsible for the operation of the aircraft in accordance with the rules of the air,<br />
except<br />
that the pilot-in-command may depart from these rules in circumstances that render such departure absolutely necessary in the interests of safety.</p>
<p>Preflight action for flights away from vicinity of aerodrome and all IFR
- current weather reports and forecasts
- fuel requirements<br />
- alternate course of action, if flight cannot be completed as planned.</p>
<p>Authority<br />
The pilot-in-command of an aircraft shall have final authority as to the disposition of the aircraft while in command.</p>
<p>No person whose function is critical to the safety of aviation (safety-sensitive personnel) shall undertake that function while under the influence of any psychoactive substance, by reason of which human performance is impaired.<br />
No such person shall engage in any kind of problematic use of substances.</p>

<p>MINIMUM HEIGHTS</p>
<p>Except when necessary for take-off or landing, or except by permission from the appropriate authority, aircraft shall not be flown over the congested areas of cities, towns or settlements or over an open-air assembly of persons, unless at such a height as will permit, in the event of an emergency arising, a landing to be made without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface.</p>
<p>VFR
* over the congested areas of cities, towns or settlements or over an open-air assembly, NOT less than 300 m (1000 ft) within a radius of 600 m of the highest obstable;
* elsewhere other: NOT less than 150 m (500 ft) over ground/water</p>
<p>IFR
* except for take-off, landing, or specifically authorised, an IFR flight shall be flown not below the minimum flight altitude established, or - if such miniumum is not established -
* over high terrain or in mountainous areas, at a level which is at least 600 m (2.000 ft) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft

<p>An aircraft shall not be flown under simulated instrument flight conditions unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>fully functioning dual controls are installed in the aircraft</li>
<li>a qualified pilot occupies a control seat to act as safety pilot for the person who is flying under simulated instrument conditions. The safety pilot shall have adequate vision forward and to each side of the aircraft,<br />
</li>
<li>or a competent observer in communication with the safety pilot shall occupy a position in the aircraft from which the observer’s field of vision adequately supplements that of the safety pilot.</li>
</ul>
<p>OPERATION IN VINCINITY OF AN AERODROME</p>
<p>aircraft on or in vincinity of an aerodrome shall - whether or not within the aerodrome traffic zone</p>
<ul>

<p>An air traffic control clearance shall be obtained prior to operating a controlled flight, or a portion of a flight as a controlled flight. Such clearance shall be requested through the submission of a flight plan to an air traffic control unit.</p>
<p>Note 1 - A flight plan may cover only part of a flight, as necessary, to describe that portion of the flight or those manoeuvres which are subject to air traffic control. A clearance may cover only part of a current flight plan, as indicated in a clearance limit or by reference to specific manoeuvres such as taxiing, landing or taking off.</p>
<p>Note 2- If an air traffic control clearance is not satisfactory to a pilot-in-command of an aircraft, the pilot-in command may request and, if practicable, will be issued an amended clearance</p>
<p>Priority</p>
<p>Whenever an aircraft has requested a clearance involving priority, a report explaining the necessity for such priority shall be submitted, if requested by the appropriate air traffic control unit. Power driven heavier than air aircraft shall give way to airships, gliders and balloons.</p>
<p>Potential reclearance in flight</p>
<p>If prior to departure it is anticipated that depending on fuel endurance and subject to reclearance in flight, a decision may be taken to proceed to a revised destination aerodrome, the appropriate air traffic control units shall be so notified by the insertion in the flight plan of information concerning the revised route (where known) and the revised destination.</p>
<p>An aircraft operated on a controlled aerodrome shall not taxi on the manoeuvring area without clearance from the aerodrome control tower and shall comply with any instructions given by that unit.</p>
<p>Termination of Control</p>
<p>A controlled flight shall, except when landing at a controlled aerodrome, advise the appropriate ATC unit as soon as it ceases to be subject to air traffic control service</p>
