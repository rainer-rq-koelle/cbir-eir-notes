I do this primarily for myself as I tend to internalise what I have to “type the hard way”. There is no guarantee that these notes are correct, and/or updated at any point in time. One of the reasons that I put them online is to understand how R/RStudio and the {bookdown} package works. This is/was a fun way to combine both aspects. I was also able to fix the bookdown deploy yml for the github action workflow. Accordingly, this repo is an aide memoire to help me archiving this fix. Need to write a post about this!
