I do this primarily for myself as I tend to internalise what I have to “type the hard way”. There is no guarantee that these notes are correct, and/or updated at any point in time. One of the reasons that I put them online is to understand how R/RStudio and the {bookdown} package works. This is/was a fun way to combine both aspects. I was also able to fix the bookdown deploy yml for the github action workflow. Accordingly, this repo is an aide memoire to help me archiving this fix. Need to write a post about this!

IDEA: REWORK AND DEVELOP SUBSECTION TO ALIGN/DIFFERENTIATE BETTER. Note: Automatic dependent surveillance (ADS) is “emphasised” with introducing ADS agreement and contract at the beginning of the list of defintions. 1.3.2 Rules of the Air Applicability The rules of the air shall apply to aircraft bearing the nationality and registration marks of a Contracting State, wherever they may be, to the extent that they do not conflict with the rules published by the State having jurisdiction over the territory overflown. over high seas: (unless notified differently) appropriate ATS authority = as designated by the State assuming to provide services under a regional air navigation agreement. Compliance with the rules of the air The operation of an aircraft either in flight or on the movement area of an aerodrome shall be in compliance with the general rules and, in addition, when in flight, either with:a) the visual flight rules or b) the instrument flight rules Responsibility of pilot-in-command The pilot-in-command of an aircraft shall, whether manipulating the controls or not, be responsible for the operation of the aircraft in accordance with the rules of the air, except that the pilot-in-command may depart from these rules in circumstances that render such departure absolutely necessary in the interests of safety. Preflight action for flights away from vicinity of aerodrome and all IFR - current weather reports and forecasts - fuel requirements - alternate course of action, if flight cannot be completed as planned. Authority The pilot-in-command of an aircraft shall have final authority as to the disposition of the aircraft while in command. No person whose function is critical to the safety of aviation (safety-sensitive personnel) shall undertake that function while under the influence of any psychoactive substance, by reason of which human performance is impaired. No such person shall engage in any kind of problematic use of substances. 1.3.2.1 General Rules AVODING COLLISIONS proximity - no operations in such proximity as to create collision hazards right-of-way - right of way a/c to maintain heading and speed unless PIC collision avoidance a/c giving way: no passing over, under, in front, unless well clear and considering effect of wake turbulences head-on: both aircraft alter heading to the right converging (same level) a/c having the other on their right to give way (“Rechts-vor-Links”) with the exception power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft shall give way to airships, gliders and balloons; airships shall give way to gliders and balloons; gliders shall give way to balloons; power-driven aircraft shall give way to aircraft which are seen to be towing other aircraft or objects. overtaking: from behind within 70deg / no view of position lights at night, to the right and stay clear (climb, descent, same level) until entirely past and clear (including changes by the a/c overtaken) a/c in flight or on ground/water give way to a/c landing or in final stages of approach in case of simultaneous approaches: higher aircraft to give way to lower a/c power-driven a/c give way to gliders emergency landing taxiing aircraft give way to a/c taking off or about to take off surface movement: head on = stop, as appropriate of both to the right, converging: a/c from right has right of way/other give way, overtaking: a/c to be overtake has right of way, other to stay clear FOMRATION FLYING 1km laterally and longitudinally and 30m vertically from the flight leader no formation flight except by “pre-arrangement” among PICs TAXIING FLIGHTS An aircraft taxiing on the manoeurvring area shall stop and hold at all runway-holding positions unless otherwise authorized by the aerodrome control tower. An aircraft taxiing on the manoeuvring area shall stop and hold at all lighted stop bars and may proceed further when the lights are switched off LIGTHS in flight from sunset to sunrise or any other period prescribed by appropriate authority anti-collision lights intended to attract attention of other aircraft navigation lights indicated to signal the relative path of the aircraft no other lights if they are likely to be mistaken moving aircraft on movement area shall dispaly navigation lights signalling relative path &amp; no other lights if to be mistaken unless stationary and adequately illuminated aircraft shall display lights that to indicate the extremeties many clauses: basically operate anti-collision lights (attracting attention) at all times (outside sunset to sunrise) on movement area or in flight Lights can be switched off or lowered in intensity by pilot if * adversely affect the satisfactory performance of duties; or * subject an outside observer to harmful dazzle. MINIMUM HEIGHTS Except when necessary for take-off or landing, or except by permission from the appropriate authority, aircraft shall not be flown over the congested areas of cities, towns or settlements or over an open-air assembly of persons, unless at such a height as will permit, in the event of an emergency arising, a landing to be made without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface. VFR * over the congested areas of cities, towns or settlements or over an open-air assembly, NOT less than 300 m (1000 ft) within a radius of 600 m of the highest obstable; * elsewhere other: NOT less than 150 m (500 ft) over ground/water IFR * except for take-off, landing, or specifically authorised, an IFR flight shall be flown not below the minimum flight altitude established, or - if such miniumum is not established - * over high terrain or in mountainous areas, at a level which is at least 600 m (2.000 ft) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft * Elsewhere than as specified above, at a level which is at least 300 m (1.000 ft) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft. BOOKDOWN EXAMPLE FOR ADDING CITATIONS You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).
