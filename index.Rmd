# Introductory Comments {-}

These comments are typed up when recapping what I studied/read in the course material.   
I do this primarily for myself as I tend to internalise what I have to by "typing it the hard way".

There is no guarantee that these notes are correct, and/or updated at any point in time. 

One of the reasons that I put them online is to understand how R/RStudio and the {bookdown} package works.
This is/was a fun way to combine both aspects.
I was also able to fix the bookdown deploy yml for the github action workflow. 
Accordingly, this repo is an aide memoire to help me archiving this fix. Need to write a post about this!

<!--
This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
